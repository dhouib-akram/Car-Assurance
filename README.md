# Car Assurance AI Analysis

## Project Overview
This project applies AI to analyze car insurance claims following accidents. It focuses on image analysis to classify and assess car damage. Key components include distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones, assessing damage severity, and segmenting car damage using advanced machine learning models.

## Features
- **AI or Not Classification**: Identify whether an image is AI-generated or real. This dataset was created using over 4000 images generated by Llava and 4000 real car images obtained through web scraping, providing a robust dataset for accurate classification.
- **Damage Severity Classification**: Classify the severity of car damage into categories such as 'minor', 'moderate', and 'severe'.
- **Car Damage Segmentation**: Implements Cascade Mask R-CNN for detailed segmentation of various car damage types.
- **Cost Estimation**
- **Car Brand Detection**
## AI or Not Classification Benchmark Results
The "AI or Not" dataset was created by generating over 4000 synthetic images using Llava and complementing them with 4000 real car images collected through web scraping. This diverse dataset provides a comprehensive basis for training and evaluating our models.

| Model         | Accuracy | Mean Average Precision (mAP) |
|---------------|----------|------------------------------|
| VGG16         | 91.32%   |            0.9840            |
| ResNet50      | 66.32%   |            0.9231            |
| Inception V3  | 90.28%   |            0.9902            |
| DenseNet21    | 91.32%   |            0.9886            |

## Damage Severity Classification
Utilizing the "Car Damage Severity Dataset" from Kaggle, this module categorizes car damage into 'minor', 'moderate', and 'severe'. The dataset assists in automating damage assessment for insurance claims, reducing fraudulent claims and processing delays.

| Model           | Accuracy |
|-----------------|----------|
| VGG16           | 70.54%   |
| ResNet50        | 64.73%   |
| Inception V3    | 90.28%   |
| EfficientNetB0  | 71.43%   |

## Car Damage Segmentation
The project employs Cascade Mask R-CNN for precise segmentation, detection, and labeling of various types of car damage, such as dents, scratches, and cracks. This technique enhances the accuracy and efficiency of processing insurance claims.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of AI in transforming the process of car insurance claims. By employing advanced techniques in image classification, damage assessment, and segmentation, it brings a new level of accuracy and efficiency to the insurance industry.
